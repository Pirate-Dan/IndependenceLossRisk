# IndependenceLossRisk
Repository of code development for a risk matrix and RAG tool for reducing loss of independence in social care

# Repository contains:
IndLoss.py - a logic model to create a rag score reflecting individual risk of entering residential or nursing care in the next 12 months.  Current risk modifiers are placeholders pending final analysis.\n
GUI.py - code for a front end interface to allow data entry and rag generation/export.\n
test_IndLoss.py - testing code for IndLoss.py.\n

# The code is dependent on the following python modules:
  pandas\n
  datetime\n
  math\n
  numpy\n
